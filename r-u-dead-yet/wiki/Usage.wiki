#summary This is where you will learn how to run R-U-Dead-Yet

= Introduction =

R-U-Dead-Yet is works in one of two modes:

 # Interactive menu mode
 # Unattended configuration-based execution

It supports the usage of SOCKS proxies to mask the attacker,
and keeps session persistence using cookies, if available.

= Requirements =

R.U.D.Y requires the following includes to be present under the same directory:

http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup

http://socksipy.sourceforge.net

= Details =

In order to run using the first mode, run as following:

r-u-dead-yet.py *URL*

whereas *URL* is the FQDN link leading to a web page containing a web form to attack. r-u-dead-yet will take care of the rest of the procedure allowing the user to pick what form to attack, what field, and with how many concurrent connections.

In the unattended mode, you will need to place a file called:

rudeadyet.conf

in the same directory as the code.
The file should look like this:

{{{[parameters]}}}

{{{URL: http://www.victim.com/path-to-post-url.php}}}

{{{number_of_connections: 500}}}

{{{attack_parameter: login}}}

{{{proxy_addr: ""}}}

{{{proxy_port: 0}}}

Whereas:

*URL* = POST URL

*number_of_connections* = concurrent processes to execute

*attack_parameter* = POST parameter to fuzz

*proxy_addr* = SOCKS4 proxy IP address

*proxy_port* = SOCKS4 proxy TCP port
